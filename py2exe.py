//#1st log on to your terminal of choice(i know that no one asked but i use windows so dont judge me i also use windows cmd

```
pip install pyinstaller
```
//#once it is installed lets go to the second step
//#for windows:
```
pyinstaller --onefile -w C:\Users\Rudra\OneDrive\Documents\codes\example.py
```
//#note that this is just an example
//#for other os
```
pyinstaller --onefile -w example.py
```
